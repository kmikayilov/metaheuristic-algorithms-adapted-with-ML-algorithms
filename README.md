Machine learning algorithms for adapting metaheuristics parameters

# 1 Introduction
Meta-heuristics are powerful stochastic optimization algorithms that showed a
high success when solving a wide range of optimization problems. However, an
offline tuning of their parameters may fail given the different characteristics of optimization problems. Therefore, a parameter adaptation that considers feedback
from the search process can be an alternative choice. More precisely, archivebased strategies are adopted, where successful parameters from the search history are stored and used in the next iterations for generating potentially better
solutions.
# 2 Objective
The main objective of this research project is to exploit machine learning capabilities (regression, classification and / or clustering) for generating an appropriate set of parameters for each iteration of the optimization process.
The first part of the research project was dedicated to a review of the state-ofthe-art on parameter adaptation strategies for meta-heuristics. The second part
of the research project was the proposition of a novel strategy. The third part
concerned the implementation and experimenting the proposal on a recent set of
optimization problems.
